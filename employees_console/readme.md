# .net workshop - working with data

This project exists to practise:

- working with legacy code (The EmployeeRepo class)
- understanding the repository pattern
- understand how to write "scalable" code
- working with list like data types and using linq functions


1. Solve the tasks in "Program.cs" by using the EmployeeRepo class but do not change it
2. Try to use [LINQ methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.count?view=net-7.0) instead of for loops: 
   - *.Select()*: Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.
   - *.Take()* : Returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a sequence.
   - *.Count()*: Returns the number of elements in a sequence.
3. There are several ways to solve a task, choose your own style and try to analyze the implementation performance wise 
4. Critically analyze the implementation of the EmployeeRepo. Make improvements if you want to.
